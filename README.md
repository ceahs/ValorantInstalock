What is this?
This is an AutoHotkey script that Reyna as fast as possible.


Does this script work forever?
It won't because, despite being diamond I don't have all the characters unlocked, breach and skye remain locked. Read the bottom part unless you have both breach and skye locked and everyone else unlocked


How do you use it?
Instructions:
1. Download AutoHotKey
2. Run Reyna.ahk
3. Queue up for a game
Hold shift and press F8 when the character selection screen shows


What are the shortcut keys?
Reyna: Shift + F8


How do I change the script depending on how many characters I have unlocked?
1. Go into a custom match and take a screenshot the character selection screen in fullscren like this: https://i.imgur.com/yKTXLeq.png
2. Go into the folder that AHK is located: Windows key > Type "AutoHotkey" > Right click the program > Open file location > Double click "window spy"
3. Open your screenshot so that it covers your whole screen EXACTLY like the game would be normally, you can upload the image to discord/imgur then drag the image into a new tab on chrome then click F11 to fullscreen it.
4. Hover over the character you want the program to instalock then on the box named "Mouse Position" it should say something like, 850, 952, for example. 
5. The confirm button and first row of character coords are already set so you only have to worry about the X, which is the first number.
6. Hover over the character and Window Spy will tell you the X+Y of where your mouse is and then all you need to do is change the "click, 1090" to the first number that the Window Spy is showing
7. Test it out by going into a custom and clicking Shift + F8 at the same time and see if it locks in the character. If your character is on the second row you will have to change the "characterY := 930" to the Y that the second row is. The Y should be about 1010.
